# Bubble Sort

Complexity: O(n squared)

The bubble sort algorithm works by swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.


# Selection Sort

Complexity: O(n squared)

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the lowest value and
putting it at the beginning of the array (or we could tell => the end of the sorted part
of the array).
