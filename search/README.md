# Linear Search

Complexity: O(n)

Here we are iterating the arrays items (for example) one by one, just like plain for cycle.

# Binary Search

Complexity: O(log n)

An interesting form of recursion, where we are passing an array, starting index from where 
we want to search and array length which is use to show to where we want to search.

Binary Search method suggests that the array is already sorted.

# Naive String Search

Complexity: O(m * n)

This algorithm checks a given text (string) for the ocurences a specific pattern (also string)
and return their index.
